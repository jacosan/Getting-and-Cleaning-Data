#### run_analysis.R

The run_analyisis file performs the following steps for creating a single, tidy file:

1. Loads X_text.txt dataset and assing to each of its columns the name given by features.txt
2. Loads y_text.txt and activity_label.txt and create a data frame (activity_table) matching the y_text V1 column index with the appropiate activity label. 
3. Loads subject_text.txt and rename its only column to "Subject_ID"
4. Bind these three different data frames in a single one (test_data) which has 2947 observations by 563 variables.
5. Repeat these last 4 steps with the Train datasets obtaining a sigle data frame (train_data) with 7352 observations and 563 variables.
6. Merge train_data and test_data into a sigle data frame (raw_data)
7. Reads features and extract measurements on mean and standart deviation to create mean_sd_Index factor (66 levels)
8. Create clean_data dataframe by applying mean_sd_Index to raw_data dataframe.
9. Rename some columns of clean_data
10. Create tidy_ds dataframe with averages of measurements by using aggregate function.
11. Write run_analysis.txt file

#### Tidy_ds dataframe

Tidy_ds has 180 observations - 6 activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) for each one of the 30 volunteers participating in the experiment - and 66 variables. These variables are the average of the observations of activities in the original datasets. 
Tydy_ds is ordered by activities, starting at laying, and then individuals (Subject_ID)
